## This is the Drifter repository for my game

Drifter is a WIP MMO where you are stranded on a piece of driftwood, with nothing but a pair of goggles and your bare hands, fation tools and weapons to defend yourself from the horrors of the deep. 
You will encounter other Drifters along your journey, they can hurt you, negotiate trade! 
Engage in piracy! 
Conquer the dark abyss below and make it back to land, back to home!
